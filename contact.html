    <h2>Reflections on Future Design</h2>

      <p>My take from this activity, as mainly an illustrator, is that design trends stretch out in all forms of art. I have seen the same designs on my page and as inspiration, only in the form of illustrations, and it makes me appreciate art a bit better, and is inspiring me to do studies and explore graphic design on my own. What I have observed is that there is a big shift in the layout trends from the year 2000s until now, since in the earlier years, people tend to gather as many elements as they can and create maximalist designs, while now people prefer minimalism and maximize on practicality in design. Although the design trends from the early Y2K have been influencing modern designs, so the design trends are circling around each other. </p>

      <p>As an artist, I have seen plenty of moments where the popular aesthetics have shifted from one design to another. This trend is recurring not only among designers but also among consumers. Design evolves from people's preferences, and unfortunately, it is shifting from maximalism, from the late 1990s to early 2000s to the 2010s, into minimalism. This is simply from what people prefer, and personally mine as well, although this does not limit to just one big design trend people love, we see people take interest in old, niche trends and embraces it, therefore, design and its trends may evolve from one year to another, the older designs would never die out, and would still have people appreciate them.</p>
